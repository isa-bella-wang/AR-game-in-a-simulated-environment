# AR-game-in-a-simulated-environment

This Unity script implements a 3D darts game for two players, managing game flow, scoring, camera transitions, and dart physics. The controller handles turn-based gameplay where players alternate throwing three darts each, automatically calculating scores based on hit positions relative to a dartboard's concentric scoring zones (bullseye, triple ring, double ring). It features smooth camera movements between overview, aiming, and close-up views of thrown darts, maintains player scores through UI text elements, and includes visual debugging tools to display the scoring zones in the scene editor. The game progresses through states managed by a mode system that controls when players can throw and when darts are cleared between turns.
